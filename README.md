This assignment involves taking over an incomplete stock analysis program. The original programmer left the following tasks unfinished or incorrect:

1. Implement selling logic: Complete the `sellLIFO` and `sellFIFO` methods in `Controller.java` so that selling shares correctly calculates costs using LIFO and FIFO methods.

2. Error handling: Add checks to prevent selling shares you don’t own or selling more shares than you have. Instead of crashing, the program should handle these cases gracefully.

3. Flexible stock input: Instead of just “Google” or “Amazon,” let the user enter any stock name.

4. Maintain existing structure: Make changes only in `Controller.java` and do not alter `Stock.java` or `Driver.java`.

The final deliverable is an updated `Controller.java` file.
